## Stacks

- [ ] Make the existing `MyStack` interface follow: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#push-E-
  - Why do the push and pop operations return the element they work with?
  - Add and understand the `search` method.
- [ ] Implement a fixed-size array-based stack.
- [ ] Implement linked list based stacks.
- [ ] Implement dequeue based stacks (implement the given java interface even).
